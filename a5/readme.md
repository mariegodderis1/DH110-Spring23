## Assignment 05: Low Fidelity Prototype

### Project Description
- My project aims to provide people with a family calendaring app to tackle the issue of forgetting special events such as family birthdays and special occasions. Low fidelity prototypes are simple ways to design and test aspects of an app layout before high fidelity, detailed prototypes of the product. It will allow us to gain feedback and determine possible problems within the functionality of the app before progressing to final design stages.  

### Task List 
The low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:
1. Main page with a shared family event calendar, with tabs where the user can naviagate to different family members' calendars
2. Page where you can view independent calendars --> comment on people's and add pictures + personalized notes
3. Template page for card generation and writing/storing messages --> option to sync with messages and auto send. 

### Prototype

### Feedback + Future Changes 
- A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two about what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.

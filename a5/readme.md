## Assignment 05: Low Fidelity Prototype

### Project Description
- My project aims to provide people with a family calendaring app to tackle the issue of forgetting special events such as family birthdays and special occasions. Low fidelity prototypes are simple ways to design and test aspects of an app layout before high fidelity, detailed prototypes of the product. It will allow us to gain feedback and determine possible problems within the functionality of the app before progressing to final design stages.  

### Task List 
The low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:
1. Main page with a shared family event calendar --> tabs where the user can click/naviagate to different family members' calendars
2. Page where you can view independent calendars --> comment on people's and add pictures + personalized notes
3. Template page for card generation and writing/storing messages --> option to sync with messages and auto send. 

### Basic Wirefames
These are basic wireframes of the main pages one would see on the app. The arrows point to 'sub pages' that correlate with each main page.

###  Wireflow
Below are a few of the wireflows of the pages within the app. The shared calendar page is the central home page of the app. On the top left corner of every page there are three lines which repesent the main menu dropdown, which allow users to click to different pages. Within the main shared calendar page, there are tabs which allow users to go to different family members pages. When the user clicks on "ben" they open ben's calendar and are able to see their events and also add a comment or photo using the 'plus' feature. If they tap on events, they can view them in greater detail and see who can attend. Every page allows users also to go back to the previous page. The third main page is the 'create a card' page which can be accessed either when pressing on an event or from the main menu page.

### Feedback + Future Changes 
I began with evaluating what features I wanted to focus on and test. I sketched a bunch of different pages and from there I created new pages based off of features that would be on the original pages. Each page gives users different options of tasks to do which will lead them to a different page, so in the beginning it was hard to think about what should and shouldn't belong on a new page vs just a different pop up. The basic wireframes as seen above are the baseline pages and features one would see. The wireframes go into more detail for features and how users can navigate from one page to another. I felt that without explanations or captions, you wouldn't be able to know what page does what from the wireframes because they are so basic. 

When tasking the user to interact with the prototype of the wireflow, I gave them little to no context on the app which allowed them to truly experiment with an outside perspective. The user generally knew what was going on but immediately had some points of confusion. Examples of her confusion were that some elements should not belong in certain areas or on certain pages because they did not seem intuitive. This exercise gave me insight to revise further and really condense features and specify the calendaring and commenting aspects based on the problems she encountered.

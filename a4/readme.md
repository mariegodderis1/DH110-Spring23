## Assignment 04: Persona + Usage scenario


### Purpose of UX Storytelling 
- UX Storytelling allows us to understand how people experience and are able to effectively interact with an app. It involves identifying behavior, pain points, user goals, and insights. All of this allows us to enrue that the user's needs are satisfied through the project. 

### Design Features
Based off of our contextual inquiries, user testing, and reasearch, I hope to implement the following features:
- Templates to generate cards/messages for birthdays or anniversaries. These can be easily customized and made personable and saved to drafts.
- Multiple tabs that differentiate family members' calendars, as well as one shared calendar with main events.
- The ability to comment and add photos or messages to certain calendared events (ex: "good luck on your soccer game!" when you see your brother has one scheduled for tomorrow). 
- Automatic sending of message on the day of the event + syncing with imessage

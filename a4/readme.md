## Assignment 04: Persona + Usage scenario


### Purpose of UX Storytelling 
- UX Storytelling allows us to understand how people experience and are able to effectively interact with an app. It involves identifying behavior, pain points, user goals, and insights. All of this allows us to ensure that the user's needs are satisfied through the project. 

### Design Features
Based off of our contextual inquiries, user testing, and reasearch, I hope to implement the following features:
- Templates to generate cards/messages for birthdays or anniversaries. These can be easily customized and made personable and saved to drafts.
- Multiple tabs that differentiate family members' calendars, as well as one shared calendar with main events. This will allow users to easily distinguish everyone's calendar's and it will be less overwhelming to navigate.
- The ability to comment and add photos or messages to certain calendared events (ex: "good luck on your soccer game!" when you see your brother has one scheduled for tomorrow). 
- Automatic sending of message on the day of the event + syncing with imessage

### Scenarios & Journey Map
#### Darren's Scenario + Journey Map
Why?
- Darren is a busy investment living in New York City. When he is with his family, he is extremely present and engaging. Although when he is living alone and busy immersed in his work life, he often forgets to reach out to his family, even when it's someone's birthday. His new year's resolution is to stay in touch and be present, even when living thousands of miles away from his family. 

How? 
- Darren records all his birthday messages ahead of time during his vacation. This way, they will be automatically delivered and he feels that he is not being rude to his family.

#### Grace's Scenario + Journey Map
Why?
- Grace's only wish is to know what her family is up to, be able to support them, and navigate their activities easily. She wwants something simple, organized, and intuitive where she can comment on activities as well as see details of everyone's schedule rather than have all of them combined (which is too chaotic for her to navigate).

How? 
- Grace opens the app and is able to see tabs with the names of her children and grand children. She navigates to her grandchild Bob's tab and sees that he has a soccer game tomorrow. She clicks the comment function and writes, "good luck bob, you're going to crush it out there on the field!". Bob adds a photo that she can see as well. Grace is satisfied because she can easily view different calendars in the tabs as well as comment and react and stay in touch with the family.

### Reflection
This assignment allowed me to adopt the mindset of the user and really think critically about what the user would want/need and how they would benefit from certain features being implemented. It was hard coming up with personas that did not both have the same similar flaws in challenges because I wanted the features to be geared towards two different tasks. In the future I would like to look more into researching demographics that would apply well to this specific app.

## Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry / User Research

### Design Challenge & Research Goal
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
- This project will support users in being able to have an integrated family calendar which reminds you of important events and gatherings. It incorporates templates for birthday cards, funny videos, and you are able to recorc birthday wishes at any time and have them automatically delivered the day of. 

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
- This activity fulfills the userâ€™s basic need of belonging and love. The user wants to show up for their family and remembering important events and sending love.

#### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
- Current solutions to satisfy this need are FamilyCalendar and TimeTree. Google Calendar allows you to share events with others but to a certain extent it is hard to remember and keep track of all things overlapping.

#### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
- Certain limitations for family calendars and event tracking are that sometimes the user just simply doesn't have time to keep up with the app and its functions. Sometimes people remember important life events but forget to reach out. 

### Specify Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
- Demographic: more likely to be adolescents or middle aged - busy working people
- Preferences: users have the desire and ability to stay in touch with their family, but are too busy/unorganized to stay in the loop and remember. 
- Expertise: users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application

#### Where would the users do that activity & what would the users do to complete that activity?
- Users would typically do this activity by either visiting family in person, or sending a personalized birthday message over text or call.

### Qualitative Research Methods
- The two observation methods I employed include participatory and overt interaction.

### Reflection & Documentation
I enjoyed this contextual inquiry assignment in that it allowed me to  really think about users and how they interact with the world around them and perform tasks. It was difficult to come up with specific questions and tasks as my project focuses on a broad theme of calendaring and family connection and there are not apps out there where people can do that. I appreciated this because the participant provided many obstacles as well as examples of what features they would want to see in their lives. Many of these are features which I personally had not come up with myself and having the user tell me their issues and how it could best be tackled was super interesting. Overall, it was nice to see and envision the participant as a sort of user persona that I could now work with. I appreciated her honesty and detail of how she goes about communicating with her family.

# FamHub: Shared Family Calendaring App
## DH 110, UX+UI, Marie Godderis

### Introduction to the project & motivations
For our Spring 2023 DH 110 UX/UI design project, we were tasked to come up with an idea and design an app related to family connection. My app tackles the issue of forgetting special events such as family birthdays and special occasions. The app has an integrated family calendar with all planned gatherings, travel, birthdays, and has templates for birthday wishes/cards and funny videos. You can record wishes at any time when you have free time, and they will be delivered on the event date in case you forget. 

### Design statement:  What is the issue? Why is it important to resolve the issue? 
Many people are often too busy to keep track of events and birthdays and find frustration with keeping track. The issue which we are looking to resolve is difficulty keeping track of family events such as birthdays, anniversaries, and day to day activities. The app gives all family members access to a shared calendar as well as individual calendars and card celebration templates as well as auto-send and reminders for special events. 

### Competitor analysis: heuristic analysis
Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. Heuristic Evaluations report the usability problems with the severity ratings and are often used with persona/scenario to clarify the target users.

The ten usability heuristics include:
1.  Visibility of System Status
2.  Match between system and the real world
3.  User Control And Freedom
4.  Consistency And Standards
5.  Error Prevention
6.  Recognition Rather Than Recall
7.  Flexibility And Efficiency of Use
8.  Aesthetic And Minimalististic Design
9.  Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, And Recover From Errors
10.  Help And Documentation

In relation to family connection and apps that connect individuals together, I conducted heuristic analysis on the apps BeReal and Life360. [read more因(https://github.com/mariegodderis1/DH110-Spring23/tree/main/A1)

### Competitor analysis: usability testing
Usability refers to the effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction that something provides. The purpose of User Testing is to collect empirical data through observing individuals using and performing realistic tasks with the product. The goal of a usability test is to ultimately improve the usabilit of the test by eliminating frustration, informing design, and improving profitability. For our user testing, we focused on the app BeReal and asked a particiant to complete the study with a UT Test Survey. [read more因(https://github.com/mariegodderis1/DH110-Spring23/tree/main/a2)

### User research [contextual inquiry, assignment03]:
The user research which takes place is based on participant observation, contextual inquiry, overt interaction. The goals are to learn about My goals are to learn about the following: 
- what is specifically hard about keeping track of important events and staying in touch with family? 
- what a user wishes could boost efficiency in remembering family events and sending birthday/important event messages.
- how the participant currently communicates with their family and goes about sending messages.

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment04]
UX Storytelling allows us to understand how people experience and are able to effectively interact with an app. It involves identifying behavior, pain points, user goals, and insights. All of this allows us to ensure that the user's needs are satisfied through the project.

Based off of our contextual inquiries, user testing, and reasearch, I hope to implement the following features:
- Templates to generate cards/messages for birthdays or anniversaries. These can be easily customized and made personable and saved to drafts.
- Multiple tabs that differentiate family members' calendars, as well as one shared calendar with main events. This will allow users to easily distinguish everyone's calendar's and it will be less overwhelming to navigate.
- The ability to comment and add photos or messages to certain calendared events (ex: "good luck on your soccer game!" when you see your brother has one scheduled for tomorrow).
- Automatic sending of message on the day of the event + syncing with imessage

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
Low fidelity prototypes are simple ways to design and test aspects of an app layout before high fidelity, detailed prototypes of the product. It will allow us to gain feedback and determine possible problems within the functionality of the app before progressing to final design stages. 

The low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:
1. Main page with a shared family event calendar --> tabs where the user can click/naviagate to different family members' calendars
2. Page where you can view independent calendars --> comment on people's and add pictures + personalized notes
3. Template page for card generation and writing/storing messages --> option to sync with messages and auto send.

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment05]
Typographic Variation: I experimented with three different fonts: a serif, geometric sans serif, and a more hand written style font. I chose three drastically different fonts to truly see a difference in feel/look within the interface. This allows me to realize that a calendaring app best fits with a simple or playful font rather than a serif like Times New Roman.

Shape Variation: I experimented with rounding the corners of my rectangles of the calendar as well as events and the menu bar option. I realize that my app will look best with slightly rounded corners and rather than straight edges.

Color Palette Variation: Figuring out the color palette was arguably the hardest, especially when trying to add gradients. My very first designs were simply black and white with simple blues, but then I added gradients to the light color scheme. In the dark color scheme, I had difficulty keeping the color contrast accessible. I aim to have my design have a versatile color pallette for many different types of users.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment07)

### Evaluation & Cognitive Walk Through:
The cognitive walk through is an activity where outside viewers can examine and walk through your prototype to provide feedback on their ability to complete a set of tasks as well as the functionality and aesthetics of the app. The main things I needed to improve on were adding color indicators, making sure there are back buttons and that users can click out of tabs, as well as removing bugs and distinguishing buttons.

Here is a photo of some different revisions and iterations I went through:

### Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?
This quarter long UX/UI project exposed me to the multi-step process of user research, testing, basic wireframing, low fidelity prototypes, high fidelity prototypes, and cognitive walkthrough and usability evaluations. Although I ran into many issues and roadblocks along the way, I was able to revise and learn from my mistakes throughout the quarter. This project was my first ever official attempt at conducting user research and following all the steps through to the final state of prototyping. When looking back at our user persona's and research, I think my app successfully caters towards several aspects of different users to solve their problems. The most difficult part for me was creating the actual working wireflows because it made me realize how many interactions needed to be created and how many outcomes are possible from just a few selections. I realized that it would be nearly impossible for me to make every outcome that I wanted (like creating the 12 months in the calendar + events for every family member + unique cards every time). I am therefore satisfied with my simple version of the app that allows users to complete my key tasks. In all, with the skills I learned in this class, I feel well equipped to start another UX/UI project of my own and appreciate the learn-by-doing method!

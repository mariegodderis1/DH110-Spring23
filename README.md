## UX/UI Project Description - Marie Godderis
My app tackles the issue of forgetting special events such as family birthdays and special occasions. The app has an integrated family calendar with all planned gatherings, travel, birthdays, and has templates for birthday wishes/cards and funny videos. You can record wishes at any time when you have free time, and they will be delivered on the event date in case you forget.

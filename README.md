# DH110-Spring23

## Marie Godderis
## UX/UI Project Description
My app tackles the issue of forgetting special events such as family birthdays and special occasions. The app has an integrated family calendar with all planned gatherings, travel, birthdays, and has templates for birthday wishes/cards and funny videos. You can record wishes at any time when you have free time, and they will be delivered on the event date in case you forget. 

## Assignment01: Heuristic Analysis

### [BeReal](https://bere.al/en)
BeReal is a popular social media app that has spread over recent years and allows users to share a front and back camera photo at a random given moment during the day to show friends what you’re up to. 



#### Heuristic Evaluation
1. Visibility of System Status
   - 2/3 The concept of this app as well as the physical layout and functionality is fairly straightforward. 
2. Match between System and the Real World
   - BeReal uses words, concepts, and icons to clearly communicate the concept of the app and what users should do when. For example, when you open the app it states: “Time to BeReal: 2 mins left to capture a BeReal and see what your friends are up to!”. 
3. User Control and Freedom
   - 2/3 The app makes it difficult for users to find how to delete their BeReal posting, and “penalizes” people for retaking it by letting their friends know how many times it is retaken. This feature often incentivizes people to take their BeReal once and not again to stay authentic. There are only 3 main pages that users can navigate to on the app. 
4. Consistency and Standards
   - The design, color palette, and layout is very consistent across the entire app. Similar to other social media platforms it allows you to connect and share with friends. 
5. Error Prevention
   - 3/3 At the start of BeReal’s launch, users often bumped into the problem of the app crashing due to high volume of traffic on the app at the same time every day – major issue because then people post late and stop using the app due to its lack of ability to function. Users can also only see their friends’ posts after they have posted their own. 
6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
   - First nested list item
7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
   - 2/3 The app is fairly efficient to use because it gives you a 2 minute time window to post – it is also very easy to understand the concept and functionality. The only thing is there are no shortcuts or many features so you can’t be on the app for very long before getting bored.
8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
   - 1/3 BeReal definitely employs a minimalist theme and a monochrome color scheme.
9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose,and Recover from Errors
   - 2/3 Since the app has minimal features it means there is less room for error and negative outcomes. 
10. Help and Documentation
   - 3/3 The app’s “Help” button leads users to “Contact us” page or “help center” page. The help center page allows users to report troubleshooting as well as learn about BeReal and all its functionality. The only issue is that the help button is not super easy to find/navigate to. 
   
#### Overall Assessment of BeReal
BeReal’s main functionality features are its sharing photo component, following and keeping in touch with what others are currently doing, and ___. 


### [Life360](https://www.life360.com/)
Another mobile app that is relevant is Life360, which is a family safety and tracking app.

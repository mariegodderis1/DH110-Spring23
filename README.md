## Tentative Project Title 
##### I plan to work on an app that centers around sharing little moments with family members at random points within one's week. 

## Assignment01: Heuristic Analysis

#### BeReal [https://bere.al/en]
BeReal is a popular social media app that has spread over recent years and allows users to share a front and back camera photo at a random given moment during the day to show friends what youâ€™re up to. 

#### Life360 [https://www.life360.com]
Another mobile app that is relevant is Life360, which is a family safety and tracking app.

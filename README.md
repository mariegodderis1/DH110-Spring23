# DH110-Spring23

## Marie Godderis
## UX/UI Project Description
My app tackles the issue of forgetting special events such as family birthdays and special occasions. The app has an integrated family calendar with all planned gatherings, travel, birthdays, and has templates for birthday wishes/cards and funny videos. You can record wishes at any time when you have free time, and they will be delivered on the event date in case you forget. 

## Assignment01: Heuristic Analysis

### [BeReal](https://bere.al/en)
BeReal is a popular social media app that has spread over recent years and allows users to share a front and back camera photo at a random given moment during the day to show friends what you’re up to. 



#### Heuristic Evaluation
1. Visibility of System Status
   - 2/3 The concept of this app as well as the physical layout and functionality is fairly straightforward. 
2. Match between System and the Real World
   - BeReal uses words, concepts, and icons to clearly communicate the concept of the app and what users should do when. For example, when you open the app it states: “Time to BeReal: 2 mins left to capture a BeReal and see what your friends are up to!”. 
3. User Control and Freedom
   - 2/3 The app makes it difficult for users to find how to delete their BeReal posting, and “penalizes” people for retaking it by letting their friends know how many times it is retaken. This feature often incentivizes people to take their BeReal once and not again to stay authentic. There are only 3 main pages that users can navigate to on the app. 
4. Consistency and Standards
   - The design, color palette, and layout is very consistent across the entire app. Similar to other social media platforms it allows you to connect and share with friends. 
5. Error Prevention
   - 3/3 At the start of BeReal’s launch, users often bumped into the problem of the app crashing due to high volume of traffic on the app at the same time every day – major issue because then people post late and stop using the app due to its lack of ability to function. Users can also only see their friends’ posts after they have posted their own. 
6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
   - First nested list item
7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
   - 2/3 The app is fairly efficient to use because it gives you a 2 minute time window to post – it is also very easy to understand the concept and functionality. The only thing is there are no shortcuts or many features so you can’t be on the app for very long before getting bored.
8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
   - 1/3 BeReal definitely employs a minimalist theme and a monochrome color scheme.
9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose,and Recover from Errors
   - 2/3 Since the app has minimal features it means there is less room for error and negative outcomes. 
10. Help and Documentation
   - 3/3 The app’s “Help” button leads users to “Contact us” page or “help center” page. The help center page allows users to report troubleshooting as well as learn about BeReal and all its functionality. The only issue is that the help button is not super easy to find/navigate to. 
   
#### Overall Assessment of BeReal
BeReal’s main functionality features are its sharing photo component, following and keeping in touch with what others are currently doing, and reacting. Its main issues lie within its app-crash and error response, but otherwise the app's success lies within its simplicity and ability to easily and efficiently be used. 


### [Life360](https://www.life360.com/)
Another mobile app that is relevant is Life360, which is a family safety and tracking app. 

#### Heuristic Evaluation
1. Visibility of System Status
   - 1/3 The concept of this app as well as the physical layout and functionality is fairly straightforward. "You are here" indicators on the app make it easy for users to know where exactly they and their friends are.
2. Match between System and the Real World
   - 2/3 Easy icons and explanations for what bubbles mean and what circles mean and different map types.  
3. User Control and Freedom
   - 2/3 The app is somewhat hard to understand how to navigate at first due to the many different features it offers. Although it does provide explanations and walk throughs of the features when first signing up. 
4. Consistency and Standards
   - 1/3 The design, color palette, and layout is very consistent across the entire app. Similar format to Find My Friends and other location sharing apps. 
5. Error Prevention
   - 3/3 No error prevention in terms of refreshing location and when phone is turned off etc. Although it does send notifications to friends when your phone is low. 
6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
   - 3/3 When navigating the app for the first few times I forgot what features meant and where to find certain things. Too complicated to remember, needs to be simplified.
7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
   - 2/3 Some shortcut abilities like imbox and messaging center to easily text friends, and live map feature updates. 
8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
   - 1/3 Employs minimalist design with graphics and nice map zoom features.
9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
   - 2/3 Location history and short trips tab does not seem useful.. Privacy concerns as well.
10. Help and Documentation 
   - 2/3 Help button navigates you to the main site and how to troubleshoot the app. No visible errors in the functionality of the app.  

#### Overall Assessment of Life360
Life360 has adopted many more features such as emergency contacts, crime reports, roadside assistance, crash detection, data breach alert, many of which have been beneficial, but when thinking about the heuristics and UX design, they have complicated the user's experience and original purpose of the app.

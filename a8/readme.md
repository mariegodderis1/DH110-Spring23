# Project title 
## DH 110, UX+UI, Marie Godderis

### Introduction: a brief information about the project.  What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.
For our DH 110 project, we were tasked to come up with an idea and design an app related to family connection. My app tackles the issue of forgetting special events such as family birthdays and special occasions. The app has an integrated family calendar with all planned gatherings, travel, birthdays, and has templates for birthday wishes/cards and funny videos. You can record wishes at any time when you have free time, and they will be delivered on the event date in case you forget. 

### Design statement:  What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 
Many people are often too busy to keep track of events and birthdays and find frustration with keeping track. The issue which we are looking to resolve is difficulty keeping track of family events such as birthdays, anniversaries, and day to day activities. The app gives all family members access to a shared calendar as well as individual calendars and card celebration templates as well as auto-send and reminders for special events. 

### Competitor analysis: heuristic analysis
Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. Heuristic Evaluations report the usability problems with the severity ratings and are often used with persona/scenario to clarify the target users.

The ten usability heuristics include:
1.  Visibility of System Status
2.  Match between system and the real world
3.  User Control And Freedom
4.  Consistency And Standards
5.  Error Prevention
6.  Recognition Rather Than Recall
7.  Flexibility And Efficiency of Use
8.  Aesthetic And Minimalististic Design
9.  Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, And Recover From Errors
10.  Help And Documentation

In relation to family connection and apps that connect individuals together, I conducted heuristic analysis on the apps BeReal and Life360. [read more…](https://github.com/mariegodderis1/DH110-Spring23/tree/main/A1)

### Competitor analysis: usability testing
Usability refers to the effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction that something provides. The purpose of User Testing is to collect empirical data through observing individuals using and performing realistic tasks with the product. The goal of a usability test is to ultimately improve the usabilit of the test by eliminating frustration, informing design, and improving profitability. For our user testing, we focused on the app BeReal and asked a particiant to complete the study with a UT Test Survey. [read more…](https://github.com/mariegodderis1/DH110-Spring23/tree/main/a2)

### User research [contextual inquiry, assignment03]:
The user research which takes place is based on participant observation, contextual inquiry, overt interaction. The goals are to learn about My goals are to learn about the following: 
- what is specifically hard about keeping track of important events and staying in touch with family? 
- what a user wishes could boost efficiency in remembering family events and sending birthday/important event messages.
- how the participant currently communicates with their family and goes about sending messages.

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment04]
UX Storytelling allows us to understand how people experience and are able to effectively interact with an app. It involves identifying behavior, pain points, user goals, and insights. All of this allows us to ensure that the user's needs are satisfied through the project.

Based off of our contextual inquiries, user testing, and reasearch, I hope to implement the following features:
- Templates to generate cards/messages for birthdays or anniversaries. These can be easily customized and made personable and saved to drafts.
- Multiple tabs that differentiate family members' calendars, as well as one shared calendar with main events. This will allow users to easily distinguish everyone's calendar's and it will be less overwhelming to navigate.
- The ability to comment and add photos or messages to certain calendared events (ex: "good luck on your soccer game!" when you see your brother has one scheduled for tomorrow).
- Automatic sending of message on the day of the event + syncing with imessage

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment05]
Summary text and image, link to your assignment folder

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
Low fidelity prototypes are simple ways to design and test aspects of an app layout before high fidelity, detailed prototypes of the product. It will allow us to gain feedback and determine possible problems within the functionality of the app before progressing to final design stages.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment07)
Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype

### Optional evaluation and revision history: Including cognitive walkthrough; impression test, accessibility audit, NEW usability testing), per each summary and link to the notes (when you share the video or other detailed evidences, I will notify you when you can make the contents private as soon as your work is graded)

### Pitch video [update the video after recording your presentation]
- insert video here

### Conclusion: what you learned throughout the process
This quarter long project exposed me to blah blah.

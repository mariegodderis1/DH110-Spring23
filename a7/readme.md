## Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype

#### Brief description of your project, the purpose and process of this interactive prototype phase (3-5 sentences)
My project aims to provide people with a family calendering app to tackle the issue of forgetting special events such as family birthdays and special occasions. My goal is to provide users with the opportunity to share calendars and keep track of family event a well as send messages and comment on events. In this assignment, I plan to create an interactive prototype for all the pages. 

#### Tasks that interactive prototype supports
- Users should be able to view and edit their own calendar, main shared calendar, and all family member's calendars
- Users can create birthday cards and anniversary cards or notes using templates and have them deliver automatically
- Users can comment on events and add photos and message from the calendar

Note: I am actively trying to troubleshoot the drop-down menu section and interactions and plan to ask professor for guidance - I would appreciate it if you don't mark off points for this because I plan to ask/revise that part and am aware of the mistake.

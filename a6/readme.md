## Assignment 06: Interface Design

### Project Brief and Key Tasks
My project aims to provide people with a family calendering app to tackle the issue of forgetting special events such as family birthdays and special occasions. My goal is to provide users with the opportunity to share calendars and keep track of family event a well as send messages and comment on events. In this assignment, I plan to create a digitized interface design for the main page, which allows users to navigate between the main shared calendar and other family members' calendars, as well as see upcoming events and attendees.

### Layout Design
I experimented with several different layouts. It was fairly easy to figure out the columns because I wanted it to go off of the calendar edges, but I had difficulty creating the rows due to the different size of the "event tabs" and "calendar" and "buttons". Therfore I chose to add more rows so I had more flexibility to move things around.
- 3 Columns, Gutter 20, Margin 90
- 18 Rows, Gutter 35, Margin 100

### Graphical User Interface Design Variation (typography, shape, colors)
**Typographic Variation:** I experimented with three different fonts: a serif, geometric sans serif, and a more hand written style font. I chose three drastically different fonts to truly see a difference in feel/look within the interface. This allows me to realize that a calendaring app best fits with a simple or playful font rather than a serif like Times New Roman.

**Shape Variation:** I experimented with rounding the corners of my rectangles of the calendar as well as events and the menu bar option. I realize that my app will look best with slightly rounded corners and rather than straight edges.

**Color Palette Variation:** Figuring out the color palette was arguably the hardest, especially when trying to add gradients. My very first designs were simply black and white with simple blues, but then I added gradients to the light color scheme. In the dark color scheme, I had difficulty keeping the color contrast accessible. I aim to have my design have a versatile color pallette for many different types of users.

### Accessibility + Contrast Check 
It is extremely important to ensure that one's app is accessible to different users. All color combinations are tested for to ensure they are above the 4.5:1 ratio, as shown below. When using gradients, it was particularly hard to figure out the correct color contrasts as gradients typically have white and grey hues.

### Impression Test
- For my impression test, I went back to one of my old intervieweees who was familiar with the concept. The user was asked to interact with the digital prototype to which they responded with the following feedback:
- 5 second test: The user was first drawn to __ and curious about __. 
- The user would like to see the side bar and click on it (to be developed). 
- The user 

### Conclusion + Going Forward + Summary of Findings
This initial prototyping and interface design was extremely experimental for me. I explored a lot of different styles and ways to show the first page of my calendaring app (didn't include all iterations here) and was able to determine what types of colors, shapes, and typographic choices I should stick with. Going forward, I want to keep my app simple, clean, and accessible. The next pages I will work on are the 'individual calendars', 'card generation page' and the 'sidebar' page.

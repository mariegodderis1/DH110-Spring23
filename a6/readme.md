## Assignment 06: Interface Design

### Project Brief and Key Tasks
My project aims to provide people with a family calendaring app to tackle the issue of forgetting special events such as family birthdays and special occasions. My goal is to provide users with the opportunity to share calendars and keep track of family event a well as send messages and comment on events. In this assignment, I plan to create a digitized interface design for the main page, which allows users to navigate between the main shared calendar and other family members' calendars, as well as see upcoming events and attendees.

### Graphical User Interface Design Variation (typography, shape, colors)
Typographic Variation: I experimented with three different fonts: a serif, geometric sans serif, and a more hand written style font. I chose three drastically different fonts to truly see a difference in feel/look within the interface. This allows me to realize that a calendaring app best fits with a simple or playful font rather than a serif like Times New Roman

### Impression Test
- For my impression test, I went back to one of my old intervieweees who was familiar with the concept. The user was asked to interact with the digital prototype to which they responded with the following feedback:

### Accessibility + Contrast Check 
It is extremely important to ensure that one's app is accessible to different users. All color combinations are tested for to ensure they are above the 4.5:1 ratio, as shown below. When using gradients, it was particularly hard to figure out the correct color contrasts as gradients typically have white and grey hues. <img width="776" alt="LIGHT Color Contrast Approval" src="https://github.com/mariegodderis1/DH110-Spring23/assets/115651524/afa32ccd-c4c9-4f64-84d3-1dd784a7abcd">
